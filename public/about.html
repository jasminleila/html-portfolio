<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I believe in myself.
  Even if you fail, it doesn't mean you will continue to fail. Be able to say you believed in yourself and kept trying. Everything that is successful will begin with you believing in yourself.</p>

<p>I treat others the way I want to be treated.
  Talk to people the way you want to be spoken to; respect people as you wish to be respected. Your status, religion, race, political views, or culture don't matter--being a good person really is as simple as following the golden rule and treating others as you would like them to treat you.</p>

<p>I understand how precious time is.
  Be able to say that you didn't waste time. Remember that time is free but priceless, that you can't own it but you can spend it--wisely or unwisely. Treat time as a resource to be invested carefully.</p>

<p>I trust my intuition.
  Don't let anyone talk you out of what you know to be true. Trust your inner voice and allow yourself to be led by your intuition. The  more empowered you become, the stronger you become and the happier you become. Avoid going against your better judgment or getting talked into things that don't feel right.</p>  

<p>I am a tough person who has made it through tough times.
  The times when life is toughest are often the times that lead you to the most meaningful discoveries. When times are tough, dare to be tougher. Anyone can run away, but facing problems and working through them makes you strong.</p> 

<p>I am a responsible person.
  Don't be the person who blames others or makes excuses. One of the most important keys to success is having the discipline to do what you know you should do even when you don't feel like doing it--and those daily decisions often involve taking responsibility for your own choices and actions. Remember that your actions do affect other people, so always be careful with what you say and do.</p>

<p> I am grateful.
  Gratitude will always make you happy. If you have a hard time finding something to be grateful for, look around you and watch how other people are struggling. Be grateful you have it better, then go out and help others. At the end of the day, it's not that happy people are thankful but that thankful people are happy.</p>
